<p>
    Writes a yaml file in the current working directory from an Object or a String.
    It uses <a href="https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml" target="_blank">SnakeYAML</a> as YAML processor.
    The call will fail if the file already exists.
</p>
<strong>Fields:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>file</code>:
        Mandatory path to a file in the workspace to write the YAML datas to.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>data</code>:
        A Mandatory Object containing the data to be serialized.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        <pre>
        def amap = ['something': 'my datas',
                    'size': 3,
                    'isEmpty': false]

        writeYaml file: 'datas.yaml', data: amap
        def read = readYaml file: 'datas.yaml'

        assert read.something == 'my datas'
        assert read.size == 3
        assert read.isEmpty == false
        </pre>
    </code>
